# What is Cerner’s roadmap for FHIR® standard implementation?
Both the deprecated May2015 and current DSTU 2 Final versions of our HL7 FHIR® standard implementation are available in production. Our roadmap always includes helping provide feedback to the current draft of the FHIR® standard, as well as updating to the latest release. Additionally, our roadmap is prioritized depending on maturity of the resources in the FHIR® standard (in other words, how stable they are considered), as well as the needs of our business partners.

# How will Cerner implement the FHIR® standard?
Cerner believes the FHIR® standard will become the public API that the JASON report and the JASON Task Force have called for. We believe the FHIR®standard, along with SMART and OAuth2, will enable Cerner Millennium to become an open electronic health record (EHR) platform that supports innovative developers.

# What are SMART apps and what is Cerner’s position on usage with the FHIR® standard?
The SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps & Reusable Technology) platform defines a specification for an EHR to safely and securely open other applications with context. 
(…) 
Cerner believes that SMART applications will be a major user of implementations of the FHIR®standard resources. We will also support access through mobile SMART applications, as those specifications emerge from the SMART web site.

# Need to hook your app into an existing EHR user interface?
SMART on FHIR allows web apps to run inside browser widgets or inline frames, so users can interact without leaving the EHR environment. Of course, native and mobile apps are supported too – so you can choose the level of integration that makes sense for you.
