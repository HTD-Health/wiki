## Meaningful use
The main components of Meaningful Use are:
• The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing.
• The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care.
• The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures.
In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.[140]
The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:
• Improve care coordination
• Reduce healthcare disparities
• Engage patients and their families
• Improve population and public health[141][142]
• Ensure adequate privacy and security


The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:
• Incentives: to providers who use IT
• Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal
• Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards
The detailed definition of "meaningful use" is to be rolled out in 3 stages over a period of time until 2017. Details of each stage are hotly debated by various groups.[143]
### Meaningful use Stage 1
The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements. Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.[144]
Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements.
__Core Requirements:__
1. Use computerized order entry for medication orders.
2. Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy checks.
3. Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically.
4. Record demographics.
5. Maintain an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses.
6. Maintain active medication list.
7. Maintain active medication allergy list.
8. Record and chart changes in vital signs.
9. Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older.
10. Implement one clinical decision support rule.
11. Report ambulatory quality measures to CMS or the States.
12. Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request.
13. Provide clinical summaries to patients for each office visit.
14. Capability to exchange key clinical information electronically among providers and patient authorized entities.
15. Protect electronic health information (privacy & security)
__Menu Requirements:__
1. Implement drug-formulary checks.
2. Incorporate clinical lab-test results into certified EHR as structured data.
3. Generate lists of patients by specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research, and outreach.
4. Send reminders to patients per patient preference for preventive/ follow-up care
5. Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab results, problem list, medication lists, allergies)
6. Use certified EHR to identify patient-specific education resources and provide to patient if appropriate.
7. Perform medication reconciliation as relevant
8. Provide summary care record for transitions in care or referrals.
9. Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries and actual submission.
10. Capability to provide electronic syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies and actual transmission.
To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to "attest" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.[145]
### Meaningful use Stage 2
The government released its final ruling on achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use in August 2012. Eligible providers will need to meet 17 of 20 core objectives in Stage 2, and fulfill three out of six menu objectives. The required percentage of patient encounters that meet each objective has generally increased over the Stage 1 objectives.
While Stage 2 focuses more on information exchange and patient engagement, many large EHR systems have this type of functionality built into their software, making it easier to achieve compliance. Also, for those eligible providers who have successfully attested to Stage 1, meeting Stage 2 should not be as difficult, as it builds incrementally on the requirements for the first stage.[146][147]
### Meaningful use Stage 3
On March 20, 2015 CMS released its proposed rule for Stage 3 meaningful use.[148] These new rules focus on some of the tougher aspects of Stage 2 and require healthcare providers to vastly improve their EHR adoption and care delivery by 2018.[149]
